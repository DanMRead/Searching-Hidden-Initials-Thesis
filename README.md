Study Organising Academic Papers Yielding Targetted Initials Towards Word Applicability - ‘Naughty Knowledgebase’

Over on the @fesshole Twitter account that I run there was an interested confession someone submitted which said "When I publish serious academic research papers, I try to get the initial letters of the title to spell something obscene."

I figured it would be possible to find this, or similar, if I could get hold of list of papers, turn them into acronyms, and search it.

This is the results so far.
