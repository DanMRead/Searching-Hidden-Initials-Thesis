Study Organising Academic Papers Yielding Targetted Initials Towards Word Applicability - ‘Naughty Knowledgebase’

Over on the @fesshole Twitter account that I run there was an interesting confession someone submitted which said "When I publish serious academic research papers, I try to get the initial letters of the title to spell something obscene."

I figured it would be possible to find this, or similar, if I could get hold of list of papers, turn them into acronyms, and search it.

This is the results so far.

The file is too big to display inside GitHub and you'll need to download it and look at it in a text editor ok?

The write-up is on SubStack:

And thanks to Happy Toast and Ballymoran for title suggestions.
